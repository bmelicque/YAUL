# Introduction

## What's YAFUL?

**YAFUL** /yəfuːl/, standing for _Yet Another Freaking UI Library_ (also standing for _Why Another Freaking UI Library?_), is as its name implies, a frontend ~~library~~ framework (according to your vision of React?).

It's designed as a lightweight, TypeScript-first, and easy-to-learn. It's not production ready though (and will probably never be...).

## Motivation

This is basically an exercize for me as a junior dev. It will probably not be maintained.

A few things I've learned:

- Extending functions
- Complex DOM manipulations
- Symbols as object keys (did you know they were non-enumerable by default? it took me weeks to figure it out!)
- Proxies are tricky
- "Best practices" sometimes make things much harder, and the gain's not that great with ~600 LoC
